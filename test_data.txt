XII. Course Descriptions
General Information
Course Labelling and Levels
Each course is identified by a two-part code. The first part of the code refers to the subject
area, the second to the level of the course. Thus, the course PSYC*3570 is a course in the
subject area of Psychology (PSYC*XXXX), and is of a level that places it among courses
in the 3000 series. The series 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 numbers are intended to indicate
progressively more demanding content, and correspondingly increasing competence on
the part of the students enrolled in the course. Courses in the 1000 series are mainly for
first year students, those in the 2000 series are mainly for second year students, and those
in the 3000 series are for third year students. Similarly, courses in the 4000 series are
mainly intended to be taken by students in the fourth year of honours programs. It is
important that students planning their courses have clearly in mind the significance of
these numbers so that they may guard against undertaking course work at levels for which
they are insufficiently prepared. A two-semester course (e.g. AGR*2351/2) is taken over
2 continuous semesters and counts as 1 course attempt per semester for classification,
continuation of study and calculation of fees. Two-semester courses cannot be split.
Course Information
The letters S, F, W indicate the University's intention to offer the course in the Summer
(S), Fall (F) or Winter (W) semester during the academic year covered by this Calendar.
Although courses normally will be offered in the semester indicated, students preparing
their course programs are advised to consult the Undergraduate Course Timetable. The
University cannot guarantee that all courses will be offered in the exact semester indicated.
The letter U indicates that an intended offering has not been assigned to the course.
Students should consult the Undergraduate Course Timetable posted on WebAdvisor or
contact the departments offering those courses to determine the semester offerings.
The figures in parentheses ( ) following the semester designation are a general guide to
the lecture and laboratory contact hours per week, the first digit being the number of
lecture hours and the second, the number of laboratory hours. The credit weight for each
course appears in brackets [ ]. A credit weight of [0.50] indicates 10-12 student effort
hours, including class time, on academic tasks associated with the course.
Detailed course descriptions are maintained at the office of the department offering the
course. Some courses, designated "Experiential Learning" courses in the Calendar
description, are deliberately designed to accommodate the need to grant academic credit
for experiential learning external to regular courses, in such contexts as co-operative
education, field observation/job shadowing, internship/externships, practical, service
learning, or work study (and other approved experience). Prior approval for admission to
these courses must be obtained from the department and instructor concerned.
Course Prerequisites
In lists of course prerequisites, "or" conditions are spelled out explicitly, but "and"
conditions are indicated with a comma "," . For example: "CSTU*2270, FRHD*2010,
NUTR*2010" means "CSTU*2270 and FRHD*2010 and NUTR*2010". A number of
courses have stated prerequisites which are prior requirements for entry to the course.
Students who do not satisfy course prerequisites, or who in the opinion of the instructor
do not possess an equivalent background to that of the stated prerequisites, are not eligible
to enroll in the course. When some specific background is desirable but not required, the
course description will include a statement of recommended background. It is understood
that the instructor may accept equivalent courses from other institutions in place of the
stated prerequisites. Students who wish to enroll in courses for which they do not have
the stated prerequisite(s) must obtain instructor approval as outlined in Section VIII,
Undergraduate Degree Regulations and Procedures, in this Calendar.
Course Equates and Restrictions
Equates - Equate indicates a course identical to the one under which it is listed. The
course may have been re-numbered or may be cross-listed under two subject areas.
Students will not be permitted to register in equated courses.
Restrictions - A restriction is a "rule" that is placed on the computer system (Colleague)
at the direction of an academic department so that particular students may not register in
particular courses. The course may be restricted because there is sufficient over-lap in
content with another course so that it is inappropriate for the student to take a similar
course for credit. In a different instance, the course may be restricted by "Instructor
Consent" so that the student must discuss the special requirements of the course with the
instructor before enrolling. Or, alternatively, the restriction may reflect a "PriorityAccess"
designation for enrolment management purposes. (See Priority Access).
